## This is the INI configuration file for Penguin WIFI Helper
##
## - Lines starting with a hash # are comments and will not take effect.
##     - For ease of editing in editors like VSCode, commented-out configuration entries use a single hash #,
##       while explanatory comments use double hashes ##.
## - Entries in the format "key = value" represent configuration options.
##     - Each option applies to the nearest section above it.
##       Do not enable an option if its corresponding section is commented out,
##       as it will be incorrectly applied to the previous section and become ineffective.
##     - When a section is enabled, its options take effect regardless of whether they are commented out.
##     - Commented options retain their default values as shown in the comment;
##       these defaults may change in future versions.

## Delay/wait toggle
#off-all_sleep = 1
## By default, the helper waits two seconds at the end of every screen before proceeding to the next,
## which can be time-consuming.
## Enabling this option disables all such delays, making navigation significantly faster.

## Update check interval
refresh cycle = 3
## Unit: days. Default is once every 3 days.
## It is not recommended to set this value higher than 15 days,
## as you might miss important quality updates.

## Color output
[enable_colors]
## If you are running Windows 7, ANSI color codes may be displayed as plain text in CMD,
## causing visual clutter.
## To disable colored output, comment out the section header above ([enable_colors]).
reverse-color = 0
## If you are a user with special visual needs (e.g., color vision deficiency),
## please enable the color features above by uncommenting the section.
